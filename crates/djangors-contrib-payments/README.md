# djangors-contrib-payments

Payment provider integration (Paystack) for Djangors, with idempotent transaction recording

Part of [Djangors](https://github.com/Chidi09/djangors), a batteries-included web framework for Rust in the spirit of Django.

```toml
[dependencies]
djangors-contrib-payments = "0.6"
```

Provides payment provider integration for Djangors with a `PaymentProvider` trait and Paystack implementation. Monetary amounts are strictly handled as integer minor units (kobo/cents) with idempotent transaction recording for reliability.

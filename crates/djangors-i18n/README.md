# djangors-i18n

Runtime internationalization for Djangors

Part of [Djangors](https://github.com/Chidi09/djangors), a batteries-included web framework for Rust in the spirit of Django.

```toml
[dependencies]
djangors-i18n = "0.6"
```

Provides runtime internationalization and locale catalog lookup for Djangors using Fluent (`.ftl`) sources. The `LocaleLayer` middleware resolves `Accept-Language` headers or session locale overrides and provides resolved locales to request extensions and template contexts.

# djangors-auth

Authentication, users, and permissions for Djangors

Part of [Djangors](https://github.com/Chidi09/djangors), a batteries-included web framework for Rust in the spirit of Django.

```toml
[dependencies]
djangors-auth = "0.6"
```

Provides authentication, user management, and permissions for Djangors. It uses compile-time genericity over the `AuthUser` trait as the Rust-idiomatic equivalent of Django's `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting, enabling customizable user identity types across applications.

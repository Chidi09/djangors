Session engines for the Djangors web framework

Part of [Djangors](https://github.com/Chidi09/djangors), a batteries-included web framework for Rust in the spirit of Django.

```toml
[dependencies]
djangors-sessions = "0.6"
```

Provides session management engines for Djangors, including signed-cookie sessions. Session state is JSON-serialized, base64-encoded, signed with HMAC-SHA256, and managed in requests via `SessionLayer` middleware and `Session` handles.

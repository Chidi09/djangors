# Changelog

All notable changes to Djangors are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.2]

### ORM
- `QuerySet::get_or_create` / `QuerySet::update_or_create` — idempotent upsert helpers; the
  `defaults`/`updates` closures return `Vec<(&'static str, Value)>` / `Vec<(&'static str, SetExpr)>`
  (the `set!` form). Requires `T: Send`; not yet wrapped in a transaction.
- `QuerySet::search(query, &fields)` — Postgres `to_tsvector`/`plainto_tsquery` full-text search that
  chains into the query as a `search_condition`.
- `QuerySet::explain()` — Postgres-only `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT TEXT)`, returns the plan
  as a `String`; errors with `UnsupportedOnDialect` on SQLite.
- `FuncExpr` (`aggregate.rs`) — `COALESCE`/`LOWER`/`UPPER`/`CONCAT`/`LENGTH` scalar functions usable
  with `QuerySet::annotate_funcs`.
- `Exists`/`OuterRef` correlated subqueries, `select_for_update` + savepoints (15.1).

### Model macros (`#[derive(Model)]`)
- `#[djangors(auto_now_add = true)]` / `#[djangors(auto_now = true)]` on `DateTime<Utc>` fields —
  auto-stamp `chrono::Utc::now()` on `save()` (both) and `update()` (`auto_now` only).
- `#[djangors(choices = ["a", "b"])]` on `String` fields — populates `FieldMeta.choices`.
- Unblocked `uuid::Uuid`, `chrono::NaiveDate`, `chrono::NaiveTime`, `std::time::Duration`, and
  `rust_decimal::Decimal` field types (persisted via text serialization; `Decimal` requires
  `max_digits`/`decimal_places`).

### Migrations
- `Operation::CreateTable` now carries `check_constraints`; `build_create_all_plan` emits a
  `CHECK (col IN (...))` constraint for every field declared with `#[djangors(choices = [...])]`.
- Migration CLI verbs (`dj migrate`/`makemigrations`/`--rollback`), dialect-aware execution.

### Admin
- **Inlines** — `ModelAdminConfig { inlines: Some(&[InlineConfig { struct_name, relation_field, fields }]) }`
  renders a child model's rows inside the parent's add/change form.
- **Tenant scoping** — `AdminSite::with_tenant_scoping(tenant_field, extract_tenant_id)` filters
  every changelist/add/change/delete query by the resolved tenant; inlines inherit the parent's scope.
- `list_filter` accepts Boolean fields **and** fields declared with `#[djangors(choices = [...])]`.

### REST
- `scoped_viewset_routes_with_config::<M>(router, path, config)` — scoped routes with custom
  `ViewSetConfig` (previously only default config was possible).
- `request.user()` convenience — returns `Result<User, DjangorsError>` (wraps `current_user`).

### Other
- `djangors-views`: named routes + `reverse()`; template functions.
- Multipart fuzz target and updated threat model (security).
- SQLite runs in CI; five Postgres-only fake "passes" became honest skips.
- Docs: new guides for class-based views, flatpages & redirects, messages, object-level permissions,
  sites & 2FA, HTTP & middleware; augmented existing guides; full crate coverage in
  `docs/src/django-comparison.md`.

## [0.6.0 and earlier]

The sections below group the history by the `PLAN.md` phase each change shipped under; the
`[0.6.0]` heading lower in the file marks the first versioned crates.io release since this phased
history was written.

Everything to date, through Phase 12. Workspace version is `0.2.0`; most crates were first
published to crates.io as `0.1.0`, but that snapshot predates every fix and feature in Phase 12
below. See Phase 12's own publish-status note.

### Phase 0-1: Bootstrap and core request/response layer
- Workspace scaffold: `djangors`, `djangors-core`, `djangors-cli` (`dj` binary), and every
  placeholder crate.
- `djangors-core`: `Request`/`Response`/`Router`/`Handler`, tower middleware layer, a real TCP
  server (`Djangors` app struct), typed extractors (`Json`, `Query`, `Form`), panic isolation with
  Django-style debug error pages, a typed async signals bus (`request_started`/`request_finished`),
  and a dev/production tracing subscriber.

### Phase 2: ORM and migrations v1
- `djangors-db`: sqlx-backed Postgres pool, config, transactions with explicit isolation levels.
- `djangors-orm`: `ModelMeta`/`FieldMeta`/`RelationMeta`, `#[derive(Model)]` (via
  `djangors-macros`), the `Expr` tree and `q!()` query macro, `QuerySet<T>` execution, model
  lifecycle (`save`/`update`/`delete`), aggregation (`Count`/`Sum`/`Avg`/`Min`/`Max`), `F()`
  expressions and race-safe bulk `update()`, and `select_related()` (a 2-query batched fetch, not
  a JOIN).
- `djangors-migrations`: a CreateTable-only v1 engine, wired to `dj migrate`.

### Phase 3: Templates, forms, static files
- `djangors-template`: MiniJinja-backed engine with loader precedence.
- `djangors-forms`: `FormField` trait, `CharField`/`IntegerField`/`BooleanField`/`EmailField`,
  `#[derive(Form)]`.
- `djangors-staticfiles`: dev serving, `collectstatic`, content-hashed manifest.

### Phase 4: Sessions, CSRF, and auth
- `djangors-sessions`: signed-cookie session engine.
- CSRF middleware, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, HSTS, and `Secure` cookie flag support.
- `djangors-auth`: `User` model with Argon2id password hashing, `AuthBackend`, login/logout, the
  `Auth<U>` extractor, login rate limiting, and audit signals.
- `djangors-mail` (console backend) plus a password-reset flow.
- A fuzz/threat-model/OWASP security review pass, and `examples/polls` as the first real
  end-to-end app (login-gated voting).

### Phase 5: The admin site
- `djangors-admin`: `AdminSite` registry, `is_staff`-gated login, a real `createsuperuser`.
- Changelist: generic field rendering, sorting, pagination, `list_display`/`search_fields`,
  `list_filter`, bulk delete, `date_hierarchy`, `list_editable`, CSV export.
- Add/edit forms and delete confirmation (GET confirm + POST delete).
- A full permissions data model (`has_perm`) enforced across every admin view.
- Converted every admin page from hand-built HTML to the real template engine, added a proper
  HTML5 page shell with dark-mode CSS custom properties, per-site branding
  (`site_header`/`site_title`, favicons, logo/accent-color overrides), and CSRF-safe form wiring.
- Computed columns, bulk actions, fieldsets, readonly/`raw_id` fields, a transitive `PROTECT`
  walk on delete, a per-object history page, and extension points.
- A full audit log (`LogEntry`) with a "Recent actions" panel.
- `examples/school` as the Phase 5 Definition-of-Done app.

### Phase 6: Developer experience / CLI
- `dj new <name>` real project scaffolding, `dj new-app`, `dj run`, `dj check` (`--deploy`),
  `dj makemigrations` preview, `dj dbshell`, `dj test`, `dj shell`.
- `djangors-test`: a real `TestClient`/`TestDatabase`.
- Graceful shutdown for `Djangors::run`/`run_service`.

### Phase 7: Batteries
- `djangors-cache` (in-memory/database/Redis-backed `Cache` trait + `CacheLayer` middleware) and a
  complete `djangors-mail` (console/SMTP/file/in-memory backends).
- `djangors-contrib-messages`, a shared pagination utility, humanize template filters.
- `djangors-contrib-sitemaps`, `djangors-contrib-syndication` (RSS/Atom), `djangors-contrib-flatpages`,
  `djangors-contrib-redirects`.
- Real field-level audit diffing and `djangors-contrib-guardian` (object-level permissions).
- `djangors-i18n` (Fluent-based `.ftl` catalogs, `Accept-Language` parsing, locale-aware
  formatting) and `djangors-contrib-otp`.

### Phase 8: REST framework and background jobs
- `djangors-rest`: serializers, `ViewSet`s, router mounting, session/token/JWT auth and permission
  classes, filtering/ordering, and OpenAPI 3.1 generation.
- `djangors-core`: Server-Sent Events streaming with in-process broadcast groups.
- `djangors-tasks`: the `#[task]` macro, a `SKIP LOCKED`-based DB-backed queue, a worker loop, and
  admin integration.

### Phase 9: Documentation
- An 8-part polls tutorial mirroring Django's own.
- The mdBook docs site (`docs/src/`) with 8 topic guides, a Django-comparison guide, and 6
  how-tos.
- A real `evcxr`-backed `dj shell` REPL.
- 100% public-API rustdoc coverage across every crate (`#![deny(missing_docs)]` everywhere), and
  every documentation code block compiled as a real workspace test.
- The root `README.md`.

### Phase 10: Hardening, architecture parity, and 1.0 prep
- Honest `oha`-driven HTTP benchmarks against Django/Gunicorn and axum.
- Real migration autogeneration (new-table + new-field diffing against a schema snapshot) and a
  fix to a confirmed `dj migrate` bug found at the time.
- Eight architecture-parity items: compile-time-enforced scoped viewsets, `prefetch_related`
  batch eager-loading with N+1 regression tooling, a pluggable/project-customizable global error
  envelope, named+scoped rate limiting per endpoint, cron/scheduled recurring background jobs,
  cursor (keyset) pagination for REST viewsets, a pluggable `Storage` trait with
  `LocalDiskStorage`, and an `S3Storage` backend plus a real `FileField`.
- Load testing `djangors-admin` under concurrency, with a connection-pool tuning guide.
- A completed `djangors` facade crate, an API freeze review (both passes, all ~29 crates) with a
  published deprecation/stability policy.
- An internal security review (`cargo-audit` plus a manual audit, see
  `docs/security-review-2026-07-27.md`) that fixed an insecure-by-default cookie gap in both
  example apps. A real third-party audit is still open, pending a budget/vendor decision.
- The Astro marketing site (`site/`), deployed on Vercel, with AI-agent-friendly markdown
  (`llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt`, raw `.md` served at every doc URL, an on-page "Copy as Markdown"
  button) and a shipped Claude Code Skill (`.claude/skills/djangors-development/`).

### Phase 11: Django-parity gap closure
- CircleCI pipeline (fmt/clippy/build/test/doc-build against a real Postgres service container,
  plus a `cargo-audit` job). While validating it, found and fixed a real pre-existing
  test-isolation race in `djangors-tasks`'s test suite.
- Migration rollback with typed `Operation` variants (`AddColumn`/`DropColumn`/`AlterColumn`/
  `RenameColumn`) and real down-migrations.
- Model-level signals (`post_save`/`pre_save`/`post_delete`/`pre_delete`).
- `bulk_create` and a `ModelForm` equivalent auto-derived from `#[derive(Model)]`.
- Real `multipart/form-data` file upload parsing (not a stub).
- Server-rendered generic class-based views (`ListView`/`DetailView`/`CreateView`/`UpdateView`/
  `DeleteView`).
- A custom management-command plugin mechanism (`#[management_command]`, `dj <custom-command>`).
- A contenttypes/`GenericForeignKey` framework.
- `djangors-test`: transactional rollback-per-test and a JSON fixtures loader.
- A genuine cross-crate test DDL race (colliding global table names like `auth_user` across
  `djangors-admin`/`djangors-auth`'s own test suites) found and fixed via a real Postgres
  session-level advisory lock primitive (`djangors_test::acquire_cross_process_lock`), verified by
  re-reproducing the original collision as concurrent OS processes before and after the fix.
- First real production deployment (`djangors-polls` to Render), surfacing and fixing three real
  bugs along the way: unquoted reserved-keyword SQL identifiers in `derive(Model)`'s generated
  INSERT/UPDATE, a `dj makemigrations` bug where new models with foreign keys to sibling new
  models couldn't resolve the relation (planned one model at a time instead of together), and a
  Docker build missing TLS/`pkg-config`/`libssl-dev`.
- Most crates first published to crates.io as `0.1.0` (superseded by Phase 12 below; that
  snapshot predates every fix and feature listed there).
- **Not done**: the remaining two example-app deployments (only `djangors-polls` is live) and
  actually republishing the fixed/updated crates (Phase 12 does the fixing; the republish itself
  is still open, tracked in `PLAN.md`).

### Phase 12: Post-1.0 hardening
Compiled after the first real deployment surfaced genuine bugs, and after comparing Djangors
directly against a real production Django SaaS backend to find concrete gaps. Sequenced easiest
to hardest.
- Quoted every remaining raw SQL identifier in `QuerySet` (`.filter()`/`.order_by()`/
  `bulk_create`/`prefetch_related`/etc.), closing a gap the Phase 11 INSERT/UPDATE fix didn't
  cover.
- `#[derive(Settings)]`: a typed, validated app-config macro (the `pydantic-settings`/
  `django-environ` equivalent) reading `{PREFIX}_{FIELD}` env vars with defaults and
  `Option<T>` support.
- A `CspBuilder`/`CspLayer` middleware (the `django-csp` equivalent).
- Optional Sentry error tracking (`djangors-core`'s `sentry` feature) alongside the existing
  `tracing`-based logging.
- A `django-axes`-style persistent, database-backed account lockout (`PersistentLockoutBackend`),
  distinct from the existing in-memory rate limiter. It rejects even correct credentials once
  locked, and survives process restarts.
- `djangors-pdf`: typed PDF generation (report cards, invoices, receipts) via a pure-Rust builder
  API, deliberately not an HTML/Chrome-based renderer (no viable headless-Chrome path in a
  container deployment).
- Optional malware/AV scanning of uploaded bytes via `clamd`'s real `INSTREAM` wire protocol
  (`djangors-staticfiles`'s `clamav` feature), scanning in-memory before anything touches disk.
- `djangors-deploy`: a `DeployProvider` trait for `dj deploy`, shipping a `RenderProvider` (real
  REST API) and an `SshProvider` (shells out to the system `ssh`, avoiding a native SSH library
  dependency). A first slice, deliberately left to grow (Railway/GCP/AWS not yet implemented, no
  `dj deploy` CLI subcommand wired in yet).
- `djangors-contrib-payments`: a `PaymentProvider` trait and `PaystackProvider`, with an
  idempotency-key-first `Transaction` model (a real DB-level UNIQUE constraint on `reference`, not
  an application-level check-then-insert) and webhook handling that verifies the HMAC-SHA512
  signature against the raw body before ever parsing JSON. Real API shapes validated against a
  working production Paystack integration, not guessed.
- `djangors-contrib-tenancy`: multi-tenancy support, including a `Tenant` model, a
  `TenantMembership` join model, membership-verified per-request tenant resolution
  (`TenantResolutionLayer`, never trusts a client-supplied tenant header alone), and a one-line
  `tenant_scope()` helper reusing `djangors-rest`'s existing `Scoped`/`ScopedViewSet` enforcement
  mechanism. Design doc: `docs/design/12.1-multi-tenancy.md`.
- Workspace version bumped `0.1.0` to `0.2.0` and all 32 crates published for real, including
  `djangors-pdf`/`djangors-deploy`/`djangors-contrib-payments`/`djangors-contrib-tenancy` for the
  first time. Independently verified live on crates.io, not just attempted. Found and fixed a
  real bug along the way: 13 crates had internal *dev*-dependencies pinned with both `path` and
  `version` (a leftover from the version-bump script not distinguishing `[dependencies]` from
  `[dev-dependencies]`), which made publishing circular for crates with a mutual dev-dependency on
  each other. Fixed by keeping only `path` on internal dev-dependencies, which cargo correctly
  drops from the published manifest entirely.
- Also covered every Phase 12 feature in the mdBook doc site for the first time (new guides:
  settings, PDF, payments, multi-tenancy; extended auth/security/deployment guides). The doc site
  previously had zero mention of anything in this phase. Every code example genuinely compiles,
  verified via `doc-code-check`.

### Phase 12.1: dj new fix, 0.2.1 republish, and site polish
- Found and fixed a real bug in `dj new`: it located the sibling `djangors-core` crate via
  `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, which only resolves correctly when `djangors-cli` is built from
  inside the cloned monorepo. Anyone who installed via `cargo install djangors-cli` from crates.io
  got a generated project with an unresolvable path dependency, and `cargo build` failed
  immediately. Fixed with a runtime check: use a path dependency when a sibling checkout exists,
  otherwise fall back to a real version dependency on the published crate.
- Workspace version bumped `0.2.0` to `0.2.1` and all 32 crates republished to ship the fix.
  Independently verified live on crates.io per crate, then re-verified end to end against the real
  registry (not the local `cargo package` simulation used during development): fresh
  `cargo install djangors-cli --version 0.2.1`, `dj new`, `cargo build`, and real HTTP requests to
  the generated project's `/` and `/healthz`, all green.
- mdBook docs pages gained the Copy-as-Markdown button (it previously only worked on the marketing
  site's own pages), and the button's contrast was fixed on both to meet WCAG AA (it was
  effectively invisible in dark mode due to an inherited low-contrast color).
- Marketing site SEO: real per-page meta descriptions (previously one generic line reused
  site-wide), Open Graph/Twitter Card tags, JSON-LD structured data, a sitemap, and `robots.txt`.
  The `site` canonical was also pointed at the framework's actual live URL, `djangors.vercel.app`
  (it had been set to `djangors.dev`, a domain that was never registered).
- Homepage gained four new content sections (pillars, get-started, features grid, a real 4-column
  footer with every link verified to resolve), and an em-dash reduction pass across the site copy,
  README, and every doc guide.
- Corrected an earlier (Phase 11) conclusion that had closed `tick_recurring_tasks`'s dual-claim
  race as "not a real bug, misattributed to cross-crate test load." It really is a genuine,
  deterministic bug: whenever a concurrent tick runs within roughly the first 60 seconds after a
  cron boundary, a single-step schedule advance can land on an occurrence that's still due,
  wrongly making the earlier fix's 520 clean verification runs a matter of wall-clock luck rather
  than proof. Captured the tick's `now` after acquiring its advisory lock instead of before, and
  fixed the regression test's setup to seed a realistic, boundary-aligned overdue value instead of
  an arbitrary offset. Deliberately preserved the intentional one-occurrence-per-tick catch-up
  design (multiple concurrent ticks are meant to share backlog work, not each grab everything at
  once).

### Phase 12.2: Error handling, ORM transactions, and REST polish

Driven by an external review of a real backend built on 0.2.2, which rated error handling 4.5/10
and REST 5.5/10 as the framework's weakest areas.

**Error handling.** `DjangorsError` was a closed 7-variant enum whose payload was a bare `String`,
with `code()` and `message()` private — so an application could not attach its own status code,
stable domain code, or structured details, and even a custom `ErrorRenderer` could not read them
back out.
- Added `DjangorsError::Api(ApiError)`, carrying an explicit `StatusCode`, a stable domain `code`,
  a `message`, and an optional `serde_json::Value` of `details`. Constructed via
  `DjangorsError::api(status, code, message)` and `.with_details(json)`; `.with_details()` on a
  built-in variant promotes it, preserving status/code/message.
- Made `code()` and `message()` public and added `details()`, so custom renderers can build their
  own envelope without re-matching on the variant.
- Added the `ApiResultExt` trait (`.api_err(status, code)` / `.api_err_msg(...)`) so foreign errors
  convert at the `?` site without a `map_err` closure.
- Error responses now content-negotiate: a project `ErrorRenderer` wins, then the JSON envelope
  when the caller sent `Accept: application/json` or the error is an `ApiError`, then the debug or
  production page. This applies to every route, not just REST. The six duplicated
  render-the-error branches in `router.rs` collapsed onto one `DjangorsError::render` method.
- The JSON envelope now omits `details` entirely when absent rather than emitting `null`.

**ORM transactions.** `Database::transaction` existed, but `QuerySet` only ever executed against
`Database::pool()`, so no ORM call could join a transaction — atomic work had to drop to raw sqlx
and give up the `QuerySet` API.
- Added `djangors_db::DbExecutor`, implemented for `&Database` (the pool) and `&mut PgConnection`
  (an open transaction, as handed to the `transaction` closure), plus the `Conn` handle that
  centralises the pool-versus-transaction dispatch.
- Every `QuerySet` method is now generic over `DbExecutor`: `all`, `get`, `first`, `exists`,
  `count`, `aggregate`, `update`, `insert_raw`, `bulk_create`, `delete_by_pk`, `select_related`,
  and the free `prefetch_related`. Existing `&Database` call sites are unchanged.
- Added `impl From<OrmError> for DbError` (and a `DbError::Orm` variant). Without it the ORM still
  could not be used inside `transaction`, whose closure must return an error convertible to
  `DbError` — the trait bound, not the executor, was the actual blocker.
- **Breaking:** `select_related` and `prefetch_related` gained a trailing inferred type parameter,
  so turbofished calls become `select_related::<Related, _>(..)` and
  `prefetch_related::<Parent, Child, _>(..)`.

**REST.**
- Page size is configurable per endpoint via `ViewSetConfig::page_size`; it was a hardcoded
  `REST_PER_PAGE = 100`. Setting `max_page_size` additionally opts the endpoint into a
  client-supplied `?page_size=`, clamped to that cap. Unparseable or out-of-range values fall back
  to the default rather than failing an otherwise valid request.
- Added the `IsStaff`, `IsSuperuser`, and `IsReadOnly` permission policies, the `And`/`Or`/`Not`
  combinators, and the `PermissionExt` trait (`.and()`, `.or()`, `.negate()`) — previously the only
  policies were `AllowAny` and `IsAuthenticated`, with no way to compose them.
- Added `current_user()`, which resolves the request's user across session, token, and JWT auth
  using the same precedence as `IsAuthenticated`.

**REST, part two — the serializer layer.** `djangors-rest` was a single 3,257-line `lib.rs` whose
`serialize`/`deserialize` were direct `Model`-to-JSON with no field control and no validation hook.
- Split into `auth`, `permissions`, `serializers`, `validation`, `pagination`, `viewsets`, and
  `openapi` modules. Every name is re-exported from the crate root, so existing imports are
  unaffected.
- Added the `Serializer<M>` trait (`to_representation` / `to_internal_value` / `validate` / `parse`)
  and `ModelSerializer<M>`, the metadata-driven default. `ModelSerializer` with `FieldSet::all()`
  reproduces the previous behaviour exactly.
- Added `FieldSet`: `only` / `excluding` / `read_only` / `write_only`, giving the read/write split
  the review found missing. A write to a read-only field is now *rejected* rather than silently
  dropped — a client that thinks it set `id` is told it did not.
- Added `ValidationErrors`: a `{field: [messages]}` map with `non_field_errors`, which renders as a
  `422` `DjangorsError::Api` carrying the whole map in `details`. Validation failures used to
  collapse into one `BadRequest` string, so a client could not tell which field was wrong.
- Added the `Validator<T>` trait and `ModelSerializer::with_validator` for object-level rules. Every
  registered validator runs even if an earlier one failed, so the client sees the full set at once.
- Added the `Pagination` trait with `PageNumberPagination` (the default), `LimitOffsetPagination`,
  and `CursorPagination`. The strategy owns both the row window and the response envelope.
- Added `ViewSetOptions<M>` (serializer + pagination + config), `*_with_options` handlers for
  `list`/`retrieve`/`create`/`update`, and `viewset_routes_with_options` so the options reach every
  handler rather than just `list`.

**Two real bugs found while building the above, both caught by new tests.**
- `PATCH` was not partial. `deserialize` walks every column and defaults the absent ones, so a
  `PATCH` of one field would persist a `false` for every omitted boolean and `NULL` for every
  omitted nullable — silently resetting columns the client never mentioned. `deserialize` is now
  partial-aware (`deserialize_partial`), and absent keys are skipped rather than defaulted.
- A missing non-nullable boolean was silently accepted as `false` on a full write. That is right for
  an HTML checkbox and wrong for a JSON API, where `POST {}` would quietly clear a flag.
  `ModelSerializer` now reports it as required; `deserialize` keeps the form semantics the admin
  depends on.

**Router state and middleware ergonomics.**
- Added `Request::require_state<T>()`, returning a descriptive error naming the missing type instead
  of the `.ok_or_else(|| ...Internal("Database connection not found"))?` that appeared 30 times
  across the framework. All 30 call sites now use it.
- `Router::mount` now inherits state from the sub-router for types the parent has not set (the
  parent still wins on conflict). Previously a mounted sub-router's state was dropped, so a handler
  that worked standalone would fail with "state absent" once mounted.
- Added `AppState::merge`, `contains`, `len`, and `is_empty`.


### Phase 12.3: ORM query expressiveness, REST filtering/throttling, and a responsive site

Continues the response to the 0.2.2 external review. Phase 12.2 addressed error handling and the
REST serializer layer; this phase addresses the remaining low scores — the ORM's query surface
(rated 6/10) and the rest of the DRF parity gap — plus the marketing site's mobile layout.

**ORM: `Q`-object filters.** `Expr` already supported `And`/`Or`/`Not` internally and the SQL
compiler already emitted all three, but `UnresolvedExpr` — the type `q!` produces — had a single
`And` variant, so nothing a user could write ever reached the `Or` or `Not` paths. Two ad-hoc
escape hatches (`filter_or_icontains`, `filter_datetime_range`) existed precisely because of this.
- `UnresolvedExpr` is now a tree: `All`, `Any`, and `Negate` join the original `And` leaf, with
  `BitAnd`/`BitOr`/`Not` operator impls. `q!(a = 1) | q!(b = 2)` is Django's `Q(a=1) | Q(b=2)`.
- `QuerySet::filter` resolves the tree recursively, validating every field name at every depth.
- Added `QuerySet::exclude`, Django's `.exclude()`.
- The variants are additive, so the ~15 existing `UnresolvedExpr::And(...)` construction sites
  across the workspace are unchanged.

**ORM: lookup suffixes.** Added `__ne`, `__iexact`, `__in`, `__isnull`, `__regex`, and `__iregex`
to the existing comparison and substring lookups.
- `__in` takes a `Vec` via the new `Value::List`, expanded into one placeholder per element while
  compiling. An empty list compiles to `FALSE` rather than the syntactically invalid `IN ()`,
  matching Django's `__in=[]`.
- `__isnull` binds no parameter at all, and `= false` inverts it.
- Both `suffix_to_op` and `split_field_lookup` were updated; missing the latter is what made the
  first round of lookup tests fail, since an unrecognised suffix is treated as part of the field
  name and surfaces as `FieldNotFound`.

**ORM: `F` expressions in filters.** `F` previously existed only for the update side
(`set!(votes = F("votes") + 1)`). Added `Expr::CompareField` and the `q_f!` macro for
column-to-column comparison in a `WHERE` clause (`q_f!(paid_at__gte due_at)`), which binds no
parameters.

**ORM: grouping and projections.**
- `QuerySet::annotate(db, group_by, aggs)` — Django's `.values(...).annotate(...)`. Returns
  `GroupRow`s carrying the group keys and named aggregate results. Ordering is dropped for grouped
  queries, since ordering by a column outside the `GROUP BY` is not valid SQL.
- `QuerySet::values` / `values_list` for column projections.
- `QuerySet::debug_sql` / `debug_params` — Django's `str(queryset.query)`. Placeholders stay as
  `$1`, `$2`, … rather than being interpolated, so the output is never a runnable statement.
- Added `OrmError::InvalidQuery` for queryset misuse caught before reaching the database.

**REST: filter backends.** `ViewSetConfig::filterable_fields` only ever produced exact matches.
Added a `FilterBackend<M>` trait with three implementations, composed in order via
`ViewSetOptions::with_filter_backend`:
- `FieldFilter` — lookup suffixes (`?age__gte=18`, `?status__in=a,b`, `?deleted_at__isnull=true`).
- `SearchFilter` — free-text `?search=` across configured fields.
- `OrderingFilter` — allowlisted `?ordering=-field`.

All three are allowlist-driven, and the field/lookup name handed to the ORM is rebuilt from the
compile-time allowlist rather than taken from the query string, so a client-supplied name cannot
reach SQL.

**REST: throttling.** Added `Throttle` and `parse_rate`, built on the existing
`djangors_core::ratelimit` sliding window rather than duplicating it. DRF-style rate strings
(`"100/hour"`), keyed per authenticated user and falling back to client IP (`ByUserOrIp`), applied
to every ViewSet action via `ViewSetOptions::with_throttle`. A malformed rate returns `None`
instead of silently becoming a default budget.

**REST: nested serializers.** Added `NestedSerializer` and
`Serializer::to_representation_nested`, which embed a pre-fetched related object in place of its
raw foreign key. The serializer trait is synchronous and issues no queries, so this pairs with
`select_related`; without a loaded relation the field keeps its id rather than becoming `null`.

**Ergonomics.** `Value` now converts from `i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`f32`, not just
`i64`/`f64`. A model field declared `i32` — the common case for Django's `IntegerField` — could
not previously be used with `q!` without a manual cast. This surfaced from the compile-tested doc
examples, which the `polls` example's `votes: i32` field exercises.

**Bug fixed: `contains` on a non-text value built a `Debug`-formatted pattern.** The `LIKE`/`ILIKE`
branches formatted non-`Text` values with `{:?}`, so `q!(field__contains = 5i64)` bound
`%I64(5)%` instead of `%5%` and matched nothing. All four affected branches now use `Display`.

**Docs.**
- New topic guide: **REST Framework** (`docs/src/guides/rest.md`), covering ViewSets, serializers,
  validation, nested serializers, all three pagination strategies, filter backends, permissions,
  throttling, and the JSON error envelope. There was previously no REST guide at all, despite REST
  being the review's second-lowest-rated area.
- The ORM guide gains a lookup-suffix table and sections on combining filters with `OR`/`AND`/
  `NOT`, `q_f!`, and `annotate`/`values`. Every example compiles under `tools/doc-code-check`.

**Site: mobile.**
- The viewport meta was `width=device-width` with no `initial-scale=1`.
- Pinned the Vite CSS target. Without one the minifier rewrote every `@media (max-width: …)` into
  Media Queries Level 4 range syntax (`@media (width <= …)`), which iOS Safari only understands
  from 16.4 — on an older iPhone *no* breakpoint matched and the desktop layout was served, which
  defeats the point of the responsive rules. This also affected the pre-existing breakpoints.
- Added breakpoints at 900/650/480px plus a `pointer: coarse` block: the hero and headline scale
  down, every grid reaches a single column, long URLs and code no longer force horizontal page
  scroll, the "Copy as Markdown" button no longer overlaps the first heading, and tap targets meet
  the 44px guideline.

### Phase 13.1: SQLite backend (dual-backend foundation)

Djangors was PostgreSQL-only. This adds SQLite as a second backend for the ORM query path,
the derive macro, and the migration type mapping — enough for `dj new` → running app with no
database server, and for a test suite that needs no Postgres.

`sqlx::Any` was evaluated and rejected: its `AnyValueKind` is
`Null|Bool|SmallInt|Integer|BigInt|Real|Double|Text|Blob` with **no chrono support**, and every
model in this workspace uses `DateTime<Utc>`. Making `QuerySet`/`FromRow`/the derive macro generic
over `sqlx::Database` was also rejected — it would propagate `for<'r> i64: Decode<'r, DB> + Type<DB>`
bounds through every method and every downstream crate. The chosen design is enum dispatch confined
to `djangors-db`.

**New in `djangors-db`:**
- `Dialect` (`Postgres` | `Sqlite`) — placeholder style (`$1` vs `?`), `ILIKE` vs `LIKE`, identifier
  quoting, float casts.
- `BindValue` / `NullKind` — a driver-independent parameter. `NullKind` carries the typed-NULL
  information that `NullBindKind` used to provide inside the ORM, because Postgres rejects a
  mismatched parameter type even for NULL.
- `DbRow` — wraps `PgRow`/`SqliteRow` with typed accessors by index and by name.
- `Conn` is now four-way (`PgPool`/`PgTx`/`SqlitePool`/`SqliteTx`) and its methods take
  `(sql, &[BindValue])` rather than a pre-built `sqlx::Query`, which is driver-typed and cannot
  cross a backend boundary.
- `Database` is an enum over the two pools; `connect()` picks the backend from the URL scheme.
  `pool()` still returns `&PgPool` and **panics on a SQLite handle**, so not-yet-ported raw-SQL
  call sites fail loudly rather than silently misbehaving. `sqlite_pool()` returns `Option<&SqlitePool>`.

**Simplification:** because `Conn` now binds parameters itself, the **eight duplicated bind blocks
in `queryset.rs` and four more in the derive macro are gone** — twelve copies of the same
`match value { … .bind(…) }` collapsed into two (one per driver).

**Breaking:** `FromRow::from_row` takes `&DbRow` instead of `&sqlx::postgres::PgRow`. This is a
public trait implemented by every `#[derive(Model)]` type.

**Integer decoding** now falls back `i64 → i32 → i16`, widening losslessly. Postgres's binary
protocol is width-strict: an `INT4` column cannot be decoded as `i64`. SQLite is dynamically typed
and hides this entirely, so a SQLite-only test would never have caught it — eight admin tests did.

**SQLite type mapping** (`sql_type_for` is dialect-aware): `VARCHAR(n)`/`TEXT`→`TEXT`,
`DOUBLE PRECISION`→`REAL`, `BOOLEAN`→`INTEGER`, date/time/`INTERVAL`/`UUID`/`INET`/`JSONB`→`TEXT`,
`BYTEA`→`BLOB`. An auto primary key becomes `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, and `column_sql`
suppresses its usual `NOT NULL`/`PRIMARY KEY` for such a column — SQLite rejects a table with two
primary keys.

**Known limitations (deliberately deferred):**
- The ~555 raw `sqlx::query` call sites in `djangors-admin`, `-auth`, `-rest`, `-tasks`, and
  `djangors-contrib-*` still write `$N` placeholders and are **Postgres-only**.
- `dj makemigrations` and `plan.rs` hardcode `Dialect::Postgres`, so generated migration files are
  still Postgres DDL.
- Therefore SQLite currently supports the ORM query path, not a whole running admin site.

400 tests pass.

### Phase 13.2: Dialect-aware raw SQL

13.1 made the ORM dual-backend, but every crate that drops to raw SQL still wrote `$N`
placeholders and called `Database::pool()`, which panics on a SQLite handle — so an app on SQLite
got a working ORM and an admin that panicked on the first request. This closes that.

**Scope correction.** 13.1's notes said "~555 raw `sqlx::query` sites". That count included
test-setup SQL. The *production* surface was **31**: admin 4, auth 3, tasks 11, guardian 5,
contenttypes 4, cache 4. All are now dialect-aware.

**Two cases were not mechanical:**

- **`EXTRACT` (admin date_hierarchy).** SQLite has no `EXTRACT`. Added
  `Dialect::extract_date_part(DatePart, col)`: `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM col)::int` on Postgres,
  `CAST(strftime('%Y', col) AS INTEGER)` on SQLite. The `CAST` is load-bearing — `strftime`
  returns a zero-padded *string*, so without it the comparison against a bound integer silently
  matches nothing.
- **`pg_advisory_xact_lock` (tasks).** SQLite has no advisory locks and does not need one here: it
  permits a single writer and a write transaction holds an exclusive database lock for its
  duration, so the interleaving the advisory lock defends against cannot occur. The lock is now
  issued only under `Dialect::Postgres`, with that reasoning recorded at the call site rather than
  left as a silent omission.

Also added `Dialect::bytea_type()` (`BYTEA`/`BLOB`) for djangors-cache's DDL.

**Still Postgres-only (deferred):** `dj makemigrations` and migration *plan* generation, and the
`djangors-test` harness (whose job is provisioning isolated Postgres databases). Neither is an
application-serving path. *(makemigrations and plan generation were closed in Phase 13.3 below.)*

**Review finding.** The dispatch added a cross-process lock to
`examples/polls/tests/voting.rs` after seeing that test fail with `401 "user not found"`. That
failure was an artifact of two `cargo test` runs executing concurrently against the same database
(the auth suite drops and recreates `auth_user` mid-flight). Verified by running the suite with the
change reverted: 401 tests pass. Reverted, since it would otherwise have shipped two
`std::mem::forget` leaks and an unneeded dev-dependency into an example app that users read as
reference code.

401 tests pass.

### Phase 13.3: Dialect-aware migrations (`dj makemigrations`, `dj migrate`, plan/DDL)

13.1 made the ORM dual-backend and 13.2 did the same for production raw SQL, but the piece that
*creates* the schema was still Postgres-only — a SQLite project could run its ORM and admin only
against tables it had hand-written. This closes the `dj new` → SQLite → running admin story.

**The blocker.** `Database::transaction` takes `FnOnce(&mut PgConnection)` and returned
`TransactionFailed` on a SQLite handle. Every migration apply/rollback path runs inside one, so
nothing downstream could be ported until it was solved. `Conn` already had `PgTx`/`SqliteTx`
variants with no `Database` method handing one out, so this adds `Database::transaction_conn`
(dual-backend, commit on `Ok`, rollback on `Err`) *alongside* the existing methods, which are
unchanged.

**New `Dialect` helpers:** `auto_pk_type()` (`SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` / `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
AUTOINCREMENT`), `timestamp_type()` (`TIMESTAMPTZ` / `TEXT`), `current_timestamp()` (`now()` /
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`), and `from_url()`. `timestamp_type` is `TEXT` on SQLite, not `TIMESTAMP`:
sqlx's SQLite `DateTime<Utc>` codec reads and writes ISO-8601 *text*, and `TEXT` affinity stores
that losslessly where `TIMESTAMP`'s NUMERIC affinity would coerce. `Database::connect` now
delegates to `from_url` rather than keeping a second copy of the URL detection.

**Plan and DDL.** `build_create_all_plan` and `build_create_plan_from_snapshots` take a `Dialect`
instead of hardcoding Postgres. `Operation::to_sql` is now dialect-aware **and fallible**:
`AlterColumnType` has no SQLite equivalent (SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` cannot change a column's type;
the real workaround is a 12-step table rebuild), so it returns the new
`MigrationError::UnsupportedOnDialect` rather than emitting Postgres syntax that would fail at
apply time. A generated migration file that is silently wrong is worse than one that refuses to
generate. The plan builders never construct that variant, so no working path changed.

**Runner.** All `Database::pool()` calls in `djangors-migrations` and the CLI's `migrate_with_plan`
now go through `Conn`; the history-table DDL is built from `Dialect` instead of three copies of a
Postgres literal. `rollback_from_dir`'s `WHERE name = ANY($1)` (no SQLite array binding) became an
expanded `IN (?, ?, …)` with an empty-input guard, since `IN ()` is a syntax error in both
dialects. `makemigrations` is synchronous and never connects, so it infers its dialect from
`DATABASE_URL` via `Dialect::from_url`, defaulting to Postgres when unset.

**Still Postgres-only (deferred):** the `djangors-test` harness, whose job is provisioning isolated
Postgres databases and whose isolation relies on Postgres session-level advisory locks.

405 tests pass (401 + 4 new).

### Phase 13.4: Documentation pass

Measured doc-line-to-code-line ratio across every crate and documented the ten thinnest.
`djangors-admin` was both the largest crate in the workspace and the least documented (9074 code
lines, 1.5%). Added explanatory comments — the "why", not restatements of the "what" — with
priority on module headers, private helpers, and non-obvious logic. Several rationales that
previously existed only in `CHANGELOG.md` or `docs/design/*.md` were brought down to the code they
describe (the `Vec<(String,String)>`-vs-`HashMap` form-extractor decision, the `html_escape`
`&#x2F;` vs minijinja `&#x2f;` escaping discrepancy, why `Conn` uses enum dispatch rather than
generics over `sqlx::Database`).

Constrained to comments only: verified by stripping all comments from both revisions of every
touched `.rs` file and confirming the remainder was byte-identical. Zero code changed in 13 files.

Eight new topic guides for subsystems that had no prose documentation: `databases.md` (the
13.1–13.3 dual-backend story, previously undocumented anywhere), `migrations.md`, `tasks.md`,
`caching.md`, `i18n.md`, `sessions.md`, `static-files.md`, `signals.md`.

**Known limitation:** every Rust block in the new guides is tagged `rust,illustrative`, so none is
compile-checked by `doc-code-check`. API names were instead verified by hand against real source.
Promoting the runnable ones to `rust,compile` is follow-up work.

405 tests pass.

## [0.6.0]

### Phase 14.1: Dual-backend test harness

The original reason for adding SQLite was that tests would run faster. 13.1–13.3 made *application*
code dual-backend but left the framework's own suite Postgres-only — ~475 test SQL sites plus 11
Postgres-specific mechanisms in `djangors-test`. This closes that.

`djangors-test` gains `TestBackend { Postgres, Sqlite }` and `TestDatabase::new_for_backend()`,
selected by `TEST_BACKEND` or by whether `DATABASE_URL` is set. SQLite needs neither an advisory
lock nor `CREATE DATABASE`: a fresh `sqlite::memory:` handle **is** a private database, so
per-test isolation is free and strictly stronger than the Postgres scheme.

The SQLite pool is pinned to `max_connections(1)`. With a plain `sqlite::memory:` URL every pooled
connection is a *separate* database, so setup DDL executed on one connection would be invisible to
the next query on another.

Ported: `djangors-test`, `-db`, `-migrations`, `-contrib-guardian`, `-views`, `-tasks`, `-auth`,
`-orm`, `-rest`, `-admin`.

**This is dual-mode, not a switch.** Postgres stays first-class — isolation levels,
`pg_advisory_lock`, `SKIP LOCKED`, and width-strict INT4/INT8 decoding are only meaningfully
covered there.

Measured on a development machine: `djangors-admin`'s 32 tests run in **0.69s** on SQLite versus
**15.8s** on Postgres; `djangors-rest`'s 45 in **0.44s** versus **4.7s**.

**Caveat, stated plainly:** five tests early-return when `DATABASE_URL` is unset, each with a
comment naming the Postgres feature required. They report as *passing* on SQLite without
executing, so a green SQLite run alone does not prove those paths still work. Run against Postgres
before changing anything dialect-specific.

Backend selection and this caveat are documented in `docs/src/guides/testing.md`.
